          once was a young boy, who as his age befit would imagine himself as something other 
          than he was. His self-portraits hung abourd great ships, atop castle-adorned towers, in 
          the depths of tight ocean trenches, the furthest reaches of outer space, and in the jaws 
          of hungry beasts. He warded against thieves, underlords, sea monsters, asteroid fields, 
          and all variety of ne'er-do-gooder. It was his world, and he would do anything to protect it.
